Formal analyses
---------------

Formal analyses of the effect of major policy changes were conducted using mixed-effects linear models with a random intercept; counties were treated as the clustering variable. The outcome was analyzed was the proportion of eligible adults registered with one of four organ donor organizations. Four successive models were created: a model only analyzing a linear effect of time; a model including a term for a spline corresponding with a 2012 policy INSERT WHAT THIS POLICY WAS; a model including a term for a spline corresponding with a 2016 policy INSERT WHAT THIS POLICY WAS; a model including a term for a spline corresponding with a 2017 policy that lowered the age from eligible enrollees from 18 to 16 years old; and a model that included all splines. All models were adjusted for the specific organization used in each county; models were compared using likelihood ratio tests.
